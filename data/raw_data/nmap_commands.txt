UDP based DDOS reflection attacks are a common problem that network defenders come up against. This is a handy Nmap command that will scan a target list for systems with open UDP services that allow these attacks to take place. Full details of the command and the background can be found on the Sans Institute Blog where it was first posted.

Testing your network perimeter from an external perspective is key when you wish to get the most accurate results. By assessing your exposure from the attackers perspective you can validate firewall rule audits and understand exactly what is allowed into your network. This is the reason we offer a hosted or online version of the Nmap port scanner. To enable remote scanning easily and effectively because anyone who has played with shodan.io knows very well how badly people test their perimeter networks.
The above commands are just a taste of the power of Nmap. Check out our Nmap Tutorial that has more information and tips.
You could also view the full set of features by running Nmap with no options. The creator of Nmap, Fyodor, has a book available that covers the tool in depth.

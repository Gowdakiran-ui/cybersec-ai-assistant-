# Cybersecurity Chatbot Architecture

## Overview
This project implements a specialized GPT model trained on cybersecurity data to assist with ethical penetration testing, system security analysis, and incident response.

## Core Components

### 1. Model Architecture (`model.py`)
- **Base**: GPT-2 style transformer architecture
- **Parameters**: 6.8M to 30M parameters (configurable)
- **Context Length**: 256-1024 tokens
- **Special Tokens**: Custom tokens for different command types

### 2. Training Pipeline

#### Data Collection (`scripts/data_scraper.py`)
- Scrapes cybersecurity content from legitimate sources
- Collects Linux commands, nmap examples, penetration testing techniques
- Respects rate limits and robots.txt

#### Data Processing (`data/prepare_cybersecurity.py`)
- Converts raw data into conversational Q&A format
- Applies special tokens for context understanding
- Creates train/validation splits

#### Training Configurations (`training_configs/`)
- **Standard**: Balanced performance and speed
- **Enhanced**: Larger model for better quality
- **Fast**: Quick training for testing

### 3. Safety Features

#### Ethical Guidelines
- Emphasizes authorization requirements
- Refuses illegal activities
- Promotes defensive security practices

#### Safe Templates
- Uses placeholders for sensitive information
- Provides generic command templates
- Includes legal disclaimers

### 4. Testing Framework (`tests/`)

#### Unit Tests
- Model loading and inference
- Response quality validation
- Safety feature verification

#### Integration Tests
- End-to-end pipeline testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Response accuracy evaluation

## Data Flow

```
Raw Sources → Scraper → Raw Data → Processor → Training Data → Model → Responses
     ↓              ↓         ↓           ↓            ↓         ↓
Web Content   JSON Files  Raw Text   Tokenized    Checkpoints  Safe Output
```

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
